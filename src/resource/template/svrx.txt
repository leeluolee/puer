⚠ Warning: Puer is planning to stop updating,  we recommend an amazing alternative:

      Server-X: Puer's rebirth, next generation dev-server

Get it via: `npm install -g @svrx/cli`
For more details: https://github.com/svrxjs/svrx

Although puer is still very easy to use in a simple development, There is no doubt that it is out of date. After investigating the flaws of Puer and its Competing products (like lite-server、browser-sync), our team redesigned a new project named svrx(server-x)

The biggest feature of Server-X is the decentralized plug-in architecture but also very easy to use. Happy to use it !
